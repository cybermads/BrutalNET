# ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
ARP is a protocol that discovers a device's MAC address based on its IP address.
# Gateway
A gateway is the exit point that a local network must pass through to reach the external internet. Routers typically act as gateways, meaning all internet traffic is sent through them.
# ARP Spoofing
In ARP spoofing, an attacker sends forged ARP packets to trick the victim into believing:
"The gateway's MAC address is my MAC address."
This redirects the victim's internet traffic to the attacker's MAC address, allowing the theft of sensitive data like credit card numbers or passwords.

# How BrutalNET Works
While typical ARP spoofing targets a single victim for data theft, BrutalNET launches a full-scale denial-of-service attack against the entire network.
BrutalNET flood the network with forged ARP packets poisoning the ARP caches of all connected devices.
